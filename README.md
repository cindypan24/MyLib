# MY LIBRARY (POCKET LIBRARY)
The whole purpose of the app is to introduce a framework which a user can use to effectively store and categorize lecture notes / pictures into different collections. For example, a user (i.e. Cornell Student) can take multiple photos of useful notes while studying or during Office Hours, but most of the time, what happens is photos get stored in the built-in photo library, which get mixed with other miscellaneous pictures (sorted by dates, which can be really messy later). We built an app that opens up a camera when launched (like snapchat) so that a user can instantly take a photo of whichever lecture notes they want to take, and they can choose which collection to add the picture into (i.e. collection: cs2800). The user can later refer back to the pictures in an organized manner, and also can search through pictures by typing some keywords in the search field (not implemented in iOS). Our backend enables this by analyzing the pictures and extracting texts and relevant labels from them.

### Note
We tried our best to integrate each part of the app into one, but iOS team ran out of time in the end and could not integrate the design into our app. So the functionality of our app will be limited.
